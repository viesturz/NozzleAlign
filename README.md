# NozzleAlign Probe
A mechanical nozzle probe to align multiple tools. And Nozzle probe offset.
Repeatable to ~0.01 mm.

## Klipper integration

### Installing

Copy the files in klipper folder to your ~/klipper folder on the Pi.

### Configuration

See the macros folder for an example.

```
[tools_calibrate]
pin: ^!PF5
travel_speed: 20  # mms to travel sideways for XY probing
spread: 7  # mms to travel down from top for XY probing
lower_z: 1.0  # The speed (in mm/sec) to move tools down onto the probe
speed: 2  # The speed (in mm/sec) to retract between probes
lift_speed: 4  # Z Lift after probing done, should be greater than any Z variance between tools
final_lift_z: 6 
sample_retract_dist:2
samples_tolerance:0.05
samples:5
samples_result: median # median, average

# Settings for nozzle probe calibration - optional.
probe: probe # name of the nozzle probe to use

trigger_to_bottom_z: 0.25 # Offset from probe trigger to vertical motion bottoms out. 
# decrease if the nozzle is too high, increase if too low.
```

### Clean your nozzles 

The calibration accuracy is as good as your nozzles are clean. 
Clean all nozzles throughly before calibrating.

### Calibrating tool offsets

- First position the nozzle approximately above the probe - the probe will find the center on it's own within 1-2 mm.

- The first tool has all offsets to 0 and is used as a baseline for other tools. Run ```TOOL_LOCATE_SENSOR``` to calibrate nozzle location for tool 0.

- For every other tool, run ```TOOL_CALIBRATE_TOOL_OFFSET``` to measure the offset from the first tool.

All probing moves and final offsets will be printed in the console.

### Calibrating nozzle bed probe.

- Do the first two steps from above to ensure the probe is precisely under the nozzle.

- Run TOOL_CALIBRATE_PROBE_OFFSET - to measure Z offset from nozzle triggering the probe to tool's nozzle probe activating.

All probing moves and final offsets will be printed in the console.


## Troubleshooting

- **Probe triggered prior to movement**, the nozzle is not touching the probe
  - Check if the probe is triggering without touching - use a multimiter to check for continuity and if it changes when pressing down on the probe.
  - Check if the pin is configured correctly. The example configuration is for active low with a pullup. Depending how you have wired it, you might need remove the **^!** for active-high.
- **Probe triggered prior to movement**, the nozzle is touching the probe, could have probed a few times already
  - Likely the initial position was too far off-center. Try to position it more accurately.
  - The probe is lowered too much and/or not enough sideways - tweak ```lower_z``` and ```spread```
