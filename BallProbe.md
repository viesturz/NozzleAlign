## BOM
* 2x steel ball, ~ 12.7 mm
* a ~20mm piece of 0.1mmx6mm springsteel, ripped mine out of 1m tape measure.
* 3x 9mm x 3mm steel rod
* 1x 6mm x 3mm screw for adjustment
* 60mm 2020 extrusion for mounting.
* mounting hardware to attach it to your printer.
* some ~1000 grit sandpaper.

## Assembly

- Clean up the springsteel insertion slot, it should go through but have some resistance. If too loose can fix up with glue later.
- Cut the springsteel to size, it will be slightly curved, polish the outside of the curve - it will be touching the bottom ball
- Solder one wire to the polished side of springsteel
- Strip about 1cm of the other wire, fold onto itslef
- Insert the folded wire in the side hole, push down the first ball - the wire should be press fixed in place.
- Insert the springsteel into it's slot, curving up, it should clear the bottom ball.
- Insert the rods
- Push down the second ball, it should be loose between the rods and be held in by the small bumps at the top
- Make sure the top ball is moving down when pressed and remounces back
- Tighten the adjustment screw to remove as much slack as possible. Some slack is fine.
